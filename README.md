The Selectable Grid project is a React application that lets users select and interact with grid items. Users can click on grid cells to highlight them or perform actions. The app uses React's state management to keep track of selected items and dynamically update the UI. This makes it easy to handle user interactions and ensure a responsive and interactive grid layout.
